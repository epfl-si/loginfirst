Ensure that users log in first in a Meteor application.

This works by blocking client DDP messages (for method calls and subscriptions), until
[`.setUserId()`](http://docs.meteor.com/#/full/method_setUserId) is
called.

# Instructions

If you would like to enforce that your application not work at all for
not logged-in users, proceed as follows:

1. `meteor add epfl:loginfirst`
2. (optional) Whitelist any Meteor methods and subscriptions that should not be delayed, e.g.
   <pre>import LoginFirst from 'meteor/epfl:loginfirst'
   LoginFirst.whitelist.methods.append("myInnocuousMethodThatIsSoImportantThatItCannotWaitForTheUserToLogInFirst")
   LoginFirst.whitelist.subscriptions.append("dittoForSubscription")
   </pre>
3. ???
4. Profit!

(Step 3 may involve, you know, putting some work into your project)

# How It Works

The server rejects any and all method calls and subscription requests
(unless whitelisted), and rejects them promptly (i.e. no server-side
[DDP message
reordering](https://docs.meteor.com/api/methods.html#DDPCommon-MethodInvocation-unblock)
takes place), unless and until the user is logged in.

As far as subscriptions are concerned, the Meteor client-side runtime
does subscribe to a handful of them automagically as soon as the app
starts, and some of your app's widgets might do same. All of these
subscriptions will get a `nosub` DDP response before login completes â€”
But that is harmless, because client-side Meteor already knows to
retry all subscriptions whenever the `login` method succeedsÂ¹. Also,
the `meteor.loginServiceConfiguration` subscription is whitelisted by
default, which is enough to let your app display a multi-provider
login widget (with server-side list of providers) if it was programmed
to do so prior to enabling `epfl:loginfirst`.

If you need to call a DDP *method* before `login` (which should be
fairly unusual), make sure to whitelist it (see above).

# Developer Instructions

## Running the test suite

1. Make sure that you `git clone` this package outside of any Meteor application. <br/>ðŸ’¡ If you insist on wanting a cloned `epfl:loginfirst` in your Meteor application's `packages/` subdirectory, you can use a symlink
1. Run <pre>env TEST_CLIENT=0 meteor test-packages ./ --driver-package meteortesting:mocha</pre>... which should give you a nice and terse green bar; but in the, hopefully unusual case that it doesn't, use this instead to investigate:<pre>env DEBUG='loginfirst*' TEST_CLIENT=0 meteor test-packages ./ --driver-package meteortesting:mocha</pre>
